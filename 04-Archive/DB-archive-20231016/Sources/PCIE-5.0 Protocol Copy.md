# introduction

this chapter presents an overview of pci express architecture and key concepts. pci express is a high performance, general io interconnect defined for a wide variety future computing and communication platforms. key pcie attributes, such as its usage model, load-store architecture and software interfaces, are maintained, whereas, its parallel bus implementation is replaced by a highly scalable, fully serial interface. pci express takes advantage of recent advances in point to point interconnects, switch based technology and packtized protocol to deliver new levels of performance and features. power management, quality of service, hot plug, hot swap support, data integrity, and error handling are among some of the advanced features supported by pci express.
