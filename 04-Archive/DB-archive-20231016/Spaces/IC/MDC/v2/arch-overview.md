This page is overview of features.
Users create documents and high level of description of a project, using a specific format of commands, then mdc tool can read those commands and generate a target code file. By using of this way, can ease the work load of humans coding the verilog low level of programming language.


# Features

For base architecture, see [[arch-baseArchitecture]]
## F-smartAssembleForDB
by processing the source file from MD, key information are collected in the database, then a `SmartBuilder` will do things to rearrange, modify extra information according to pre-defined user setup file or default setup file. The smart builder will be called like:
```ruby
smb = SmartBuilder.new(db);
smb.optimizeDataBase();
```
Details of this object refer to: [[src-smartBuilder.rb]].
## F-generateFileFromDB
The generate unit will generate the target file from the optimized database, like:
```ruby
gen = Generator.new(db);
gen.publish();
```
The main architecture kept like these, but for now, only SV are supported.
Details of this object refer to: [[src-generator.rb]].
# F-processSVSupportedMDs
There'll be a database that can be called to process the source of MD contents through the `FileProcessor` class.
A class `SVSupport` which derives from `DataBase` is developed to process the SV MD files and collect all information from those MD files, translated into a common database formats, and will be generated by a `Generator` finally. process will be like:
```ruby
        fp = FileProcessor.new(@options.source);
        db = nil;
        if fp.codeType == :SV
            ## 2.if SV file, then load sv processor
            db = SVSupport.new(fp);
        else
            db = CPPSupport.new(fp);
        end
        ## 3.process source file, store information into db
        db.processSource();
```
For details of `SVSupport`, see [[src-svSupport.rb]].
