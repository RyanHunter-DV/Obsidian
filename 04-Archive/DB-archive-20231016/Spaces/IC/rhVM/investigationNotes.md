# Enhancement or Requirement
#TODO 
- need more ability for cpp programming
- need more cpp libraries
- need more knowledge of vpi
- need setup basic library for VPI, such as driving a signal through VPI, we need a lib that can easily call the API (such as driveSignal) instead of building a complex VPI program.

# Records
investigation done, we can drive the signal through vpi, but need a more detailed architecture and plan to build this verification methodology.
