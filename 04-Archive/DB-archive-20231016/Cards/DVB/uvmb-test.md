This will build simple test component, with user configurations, all fields, apis are user determined. For specific usage, a high level tool can be developed to build different tests by calling the 'uvmb' executor with different generated source files.
For example, in `TestBuilder` tool set, more built-in features are provided by the tool, such as test_loop. As for users of `TestBuilder`, they only required to specify kinda a test template, or test with simple declared flows or sequences. And that tool will arrange those information and finally generate a user source file for 'uvmb' executor to generate target SV files.
